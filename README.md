# Restaurant Page

Restaurant page with **Vanilla JS** using `classes`, `ES6 modules` and bundling with `Webpack`.

This is a **single-page application (SPA)**, so all the content for every tab is generated dynamically with JS.

#### What I have practiced in this project?

The main focus was on using the `classes` and the `ES6 modules` to structure the code. Also, I learned how to use the `Webpack` to bundle everything.
